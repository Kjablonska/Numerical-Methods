# Numerical-Methods
  
## Introduction  
  
This is a collection of three projects creeated for ENUME course at Warsaw University of Technology. All projects are written in MATLAB.

Each project is stored on a separate branch with respective READMEs containing descriptions.
Please check below for a short list of the projects.
